# Autonomous-Taxi-Agent
It is the agent of Taxi-v3 based on **OpenAI Gym** environment with the implementation of Q-Learning algorithm.

## OpenAI Gym Taxi-v3
https://gym.openai.com/envs/Taxi-v3/<br>

OpenAI Gym is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. This is the gym open-source library, which gives you access to a standardized set of environments.

## Q-Learning
**Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the value of an action in a particular state. <br>
It does not require a model of the environment (hence "model-free"), and it can handle problems with stochastic transitions and rewards without requiring adaptations.**
